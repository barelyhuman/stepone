# stepone

This is what I have setup on my macbook right now this doesn't configure
anything but vim and zsh.

It creates a fresh install for apps that'll need to be configured since I like
starting from scratch

## usage

1. download this as zip
2. extract and change into the folder
3. run the `./setup.sh` script from whichever folder you wish to.

```sh
sh setup.sh
# or
./setup.sh
```

## Full Setup

This will setup a development environment for the following

- Zig
- Go
- Nim
- Node
- iOS Development (XCode)
- Android Development
- Vim + NeoVim (0 phase setup)
- Necessary Browsers(firefox + chromium) and Development Tools for Web Dev and
  Dev Ops (Docker, Table Plus, Postico)

## Minimal Setup

This will take care of installing just the following

- Go
- Node
- Vim (0 Phase Setup)
- Minimal Web Dev setup, (Postgres + Tableplus + Firefox)
