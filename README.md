# stepone

This is what I have setup on my macbook right now this doesn't configure anything
but vim and zsh.

It creates a fresh install for apps that'll need to be configured
since I like starting from scratch

## usage

1. download this as zip
2. extract and change into the folder
3. run the `./setup.sh` script

```sh
sh setup.sh
# or
./setup.sh
```
